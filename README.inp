After over ten years' development, PSOKINV has widely been used in geophysics community globally. (I am glad to see some of my works in the past are 
   useful.) PSOKINV is a geodetic data based inversion package to help arrange geophysical inversion with multipel geodetic data, e.g. GPS/InSAR/GRAVITY.
   With my increasing knowledge of computer sciences, the structure of PSOINV is NOT optimal at all in designing. Too many global parameters are used 
   in the current version and some of them have been obsolete. A manual for the use of the package has been required by many times. Unfortunately, no complete
   manual is done yet. There is another reason why I start working on README. The current version is full of bugs/weaknesses. We need to track the updates
   and modification history clearly as well. Basically, this works mainly for my self or any other developer starting from psokinv. I am afraid that this document
   cannot be treated as a manual. You won't find any instruction on MPSO, and any other functions used in the package. Anyway, let us do it now...

   1. unit of displacements is added today.
      - This keyword matters when moment magnitude (mw) is allowed to estimate the size of the earthquake. 
	  - The new option is available now. We can define the unit of the data with 
	     - # unit of displacements: m,cm or mm
		 - m for meter in default
		 - sim_invconfig.m and sim_readconfig.m have both been modified towards a better solution in non-linear inversion.

   1. A bug for downsampling azimuth offset data. 
      - The last version of ps_dsm cannot return correct projection vections for azimuth offset data. Now few functions were fixed including
	     - sim_rquads.m 
		 - sim_quad2okinv.m
   2. add one option for the non-linear global searching. 
      - mwall, another global parameter again. (no better way to arrange this...)
	  - in default, mwall is 1, which means that the constraints of boundary moment magnitudes will only work for the total seismic moment. In another words,
	    for example, several faults could be involed in the modelling, but the settings of mw boudaries will be only checked for the total seismic moment. In this case,
		the boundary mw should be identical too for any individual fault. 
	  - relevent functions include
	     - sim_FUNCinvnfault.m
		 - sim_invconfig.m
		 - sim_readconfig.m
		 - sim_obj_conrake.m 
   3. fix several bugs/urgly settings in ps_dsm package.
      - azi and azimuth now have been both supported in ps_dsm. Previously, azimuth will cause some problems in the application.
	  - range and rng are similar as the above.
	  - improve the output format to avoid some potential editing issues. Improvements were made in the current version including 
	     - sim_rquads.m
		 - sim_rbfunc.m
